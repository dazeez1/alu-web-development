# 0x08. User authentication service

In the industry, you should not implement your own authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-User](https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Resources
**Read or watch:**

* [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)
* [Requests module](https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/master/user/quickstart/)
* [HTTP status codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* You should use SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\_\_import\_\_("my_module").\_\_doc\_\_)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\_\_import\_\_("my_module").MyClass.\_\_doc\_\_)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\_\_import\_\_("my_module").my_function.\_\_doc\_\_)' and python3 -c 'print(\_\_import\_\_("my_module").MyClass.my_function.\_\_doc\_\_)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions should be type annotated
* The flask app should only interact with Auth and never with DB directly.
* Only public methods of Auth and DB should be used outside these classes
## Setup
You will need to install `bcrypt`

```bash
pip3 install bcrypt
```
